The trajectory details an extensive debugging and feature addition process for a full-stack CV application. Initially, the focus was on deploying a React frontend, FastAPI backend, and MongoDB via Docker and Portainer, addressing numerous health check and build issues. The user then requested a simplified Portainer YML, leading to further iterations on data initialization strategies, including a web-based import/export system. Persistent issues with frontend-backend communication due to incorrect URLs and CORS led to an attempt at a single-container deployment. This, however, introduced new problems, including an Internal Server Error during data import and continued MongoDB connectivity failures within Docker. The AI engineered various diagnostic tools and YML configurations, ultimately reverting to a two-container architecture. The core problem at the trajectory's end remains MongoDB hostname resolution within the Docker network.

The user required a modern, conversion-optimized CV landing page for Hernando Montoya Oliveros with an aesthetic blue color palette, animations, glassmorphism, responsiveness, and dynamic multi-language (English, Spanish, French) content. It needed a professional profile image, hero, experience, education, and skills sections, a PDF download, and a contact form. Later, a secure, basic content management system (CMS) was requested for the Admin Panel to modify Personal, About, Skills, Languages, Experience, and Education sections, with an explicit request to remove the Emergent badge. The application then needed Dockerized deployment for local use and Portainer on a VM with Nginx Proxy Manager (NPM).

During the trajectory, the user explicitly requested:
- A simplified Portainer YML with frontend on port 8006 and backend on port 8007, without NPM configuration within the YML.
- Automatic and rapid data initialization for immediate use.
- After initialization failures, a web-based data import/export system within the backend.
- Debugging for connection issues between frontend and backend during import/initialization.
- A functional frontend reachable at .
- Resolution of MongoDB connectivity issues within the Docker network.

<key_technical_concepts>
- **Full-stack Architecture**: React (Frontend), FastAPI (Backend), MongoDB (Database).
- **Deployment**: Docker, Docker Compose, Portainer, Nginx (for frontend serving), Kubernetes Ingress.
- **Authentication**: JWT for Admin Panel access.
- **Data Management**: Pydantic, Motor (async MongoDB driver),  (sync MongoDB driver).
- **Networking**: Docker networking, hostname resolution, port mapping, CORS.
- **Health Checks**: Docker health checks, Uvicorn process verification.

<code_architecture>
The application is structured as a monorepo in the  directory, containing  (FastAPI) and  (React) subdirectories, along with various Docker and deployment-related files.

**Key Files and Changes:**
-   : The main FastAPI application. Was modified to add a  endpoint, error handling for MongoDB connection at startup, and crucially, to serve static frontend files when a single container approach was attempted. It includes CORS middleware.
-   : **NEW** endpoint for importing and exporting CV data via JSON. This was a significant feature addition to handle data initialization post-deployment.
-   : **NEW** endpoint for diagnosing network connectivity and MongoDB host resolution from the backend's perspective.
-   : Iterated on multiple times. Initially for health checks, then replaced by  for stability,  for a single-container setup, and  to ensure environment variables are processed before the frontend build stage.
-   : Main React component.
-   : Central Admin Panel. It was heavily modified to include new tabs for Import, Debug, CORS, System, and Network to facilitate data management and troubleshooting. It integrates several new diagnostic and functional components.
-   : **NEW** React components for import/export functionality, and various debugging/diagnostic tools for frontend-backend connection, CORS, system health, and network issues. The  and  components were refactored into  and  due to  issues.
-   : This critical file was frequently updated, either manually or via scripts, to correctly point  to , , a specific IP (), or an empty string for the combined container approach, then back to the specific IP for the two-container approach.
-   : Numerous Portainer stack files were created (, , , , , , , , , , , , etc.) to address deployment issues, health checks, port mappings, data initialization strategies, and container architectures (single vs. two containers). The latest  attempts to revert to a stable two-container setup.
-   : **NEW** sample JSON file for data import.
-    (diagnostic scripts): Several Python scripts (, , , , , ) were created to aid in diagnosing backend, MongoDB, and networking issues.
-    (solution guides): Numerous markdown files were generated to document problems and their attempted solutions, like  or .
</code_architecture>

<pending_tasks>
- Resolve the MongoDB hostname resolution issue (, ) within the Docker network, as detected by the Network debug tab.
- Successfully establish backend connectivity to MongoDB to enable data import functionality.
- Ensure the frontend can reliably connect to the backend and fully utilize the import/export features.

Immediately before this summary, the AI engineer was addressing persistent MongoDB connectivity issues. The user reported that the frontend was not loading () after an attempt to simplify the deployment by combining frontend and backend into a single container (). This led the AI to go back to basics, reverting to a two-container setup (frontend and backend separately, plus MongoDB) using .

After redeploying with this back to basics stack, a diagnostic check (likely via the Network tab in the Admin Panel or a custom script) revealed that  and  hostnames were failing to resolve (). This indicated a fundamental problem with Docker's internal DNS resolution between containers. While  resolved,  showed , which is expected since MongoDB is in a separate container.

The last action taken by the AI was to create a Python script, , to programmatically obtain the IP address of the MongoDB container. This suggests the current approach is to bypass hostname resolution issues by using direct IP addresses for inter-container communication, particularly for the backend to connect to MongoDB. The frontend's  and several React components (, , ) were already reverted to use the user's explicit IP () for backend communication.
