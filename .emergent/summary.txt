The previous AI engineer successfully developed a full-stack modern CV application from scratch. The initial phase involved extracting data from a user-provided PDF, building a React frontend with mock data, and integrating a blue color palette, dynamic language selection, a profile image, PDF download, and a contact form. Several frontend bugs were debugged and fixed. Subsequently, a content management system (CMS) was implemented, comprising a FastAPI backend with MongoDB and a React Admin Panel. This CMS featured secure JWT authentication and allowed editing personal, about, skills, and language information. The latter part of the trajectory focused heavily on Dockerizing the application, addressing multiple deployment issues locally (Craco/React incompatibility, Docker daemon not running, Nginx configuration errors) and then for Portainer, including persistent MongoDB health check failures and a backend health check loop. The engineer consistently followed explicit user requests and provided detailed explanations and solutions throughout the development process.

<product_requirements>
The user initially requested a modern, conversion-optimized CV landing page for Hernando Montoya Oliveros. Key requirements included:
-   **Design**: Aesthetically pleasing with a blue color palette, animations, glassmorphism effects, and responsive layout.
-   **Content**: Dynamic language switching (English, Spanish, French), a professional profile image (user-provided), a compelling hero section, detailed experience, education, and skills sections derived from the provided CV.
-   **Functionality**: PDF CV download button and a functional contact form.

Later, the user requested a basic, easy-to-use content manager (CMS) to edit content without code. This evolved into requiring:
-   **Admin Panel**: Ability to modify Personal, About, Skills, Languages, Experience, and Education sections.
-   **Security**: Authentication for the Admin Panel.
-   **Branding**: Removal of the Emergent badge.
-   **Deployment**: Generation of Dockerfiles for local deployment and an optimized Docker Compose stack for Portainer deployment on a VM, managed with Nginx Proxy Manager (NPM).

The product currently is a functional, full-stack CV application featuring a modern React frontend, a FastAPI backend, and a MongoDB database. It includes a secure, multi-language content management system accessible via an Admin Panel, and is prepared for Dockerized deployment with comprehensive documentation and scripts.
</product_requirements>

<key_technical_concepts>
-   **Full-stack Architecture**: React (Frontend), FastAPI (Backend), MongoDB (Database).
-   **UI Framework**: Shadcn UI, Tailwind CSS for styling.
-   **Deployment**: Docker, Docker Compose, Portainer, Nginx (for frontend serving), Nginx Proxy Manager (NPM).
-   **Authentication**: JSON Web Tokens (JWT) for secure Admin Panel access.
-   **Data Management**: Pydantic models for data validation, Motor for async MongoDB.
</key_technical_concepts>

<code_architecture>
The application is structured as a monorepo with  (React) and  (FastAPI) directories.



**Key Files and Changes:**

-   : Main FastAPI app. Modified to include API routes for content and authentication, CORS middleware, and a database shutdown event.
-   : Defines Pydantic models for various content types (Personal, About, Experience, Education, Skills, Languages, Contact).
-   : Implements CRUD endpoints for managing content in MongoDB.
-   : Defines Pydantic models for user (login, register) and JWT token.
-   : Implements authentication endpoints (login) with JWT generation and password hashing.
-   : Script to populate MongoDB with initial CV data.
-   : Optimized Dockerfile for the FastAPI backend, with a health check now verifying the Uvicorn process directly (pgrep).
-   : Main React component. Configured with , , , , , and routes to various sections, including the .
-   : React component for the content management interface. Features tabs for different content sections, input fields, and save functionality. Modified to include Experience and Education tabs and to load/save real data.
-   : React component for the login modal, integrating JWT authentication.
-   : Custom React hook to fetch and manage application content from the backend.
-   : Multi-stage Dockerfile for the React frontend, building the app and serving it with Nginx. It was heavily iterated on to resolve /Craco incompatibility,  inclusion, and Nginx configuration errors. Includes Node.js 16 and React 18 for stability.
-   : Nginx configuration for serving the React build. Corrected  directives to valid values.
-   , : Docker Compose files for development and production environments, defining services for frontend, backend, and MongoDB.
-   : The latest Docker Compose file optimized for Portainer deployment, incorporating fixes for MongoDB and backend health checks.
-   ðŸš€ Starting CV Application Deployment
[0;31m[ERROR][0m Docker is not installed. Please install Docker first.: Script to automate local and production Docker deployments.
-   , : Docker ignore files. The  was explicitly removed from  to ensure it's included in the build context.
-   : Modified to remove the Made with Emergent badge.
</code_architecture>

<pending_tasks>
-   The user needs to test the latest  and updated Dockerfiles to confirm the backend health check issue is resolved during Portainer deployment.
-   No other explicit tasks are pending beyond the successful deployment in Portainer.

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary request, the AI engineer was addressing a backend health check failure during Portainer deployment. The error  indicated that the backend's health check was attempting to make an HTTP request to Uvicorn before the server was fully initialized within its container.

To fix this, the AI engineer modified the  for both backend and frontend. For the backend, the problematic HTTP-based health check was replaced with a more reliable command that verifies if the  process is running:
.
Additionally, timeouts were adjusted for the frontend Dockerfile to improve robustness. These changes were consolidated into .

<optional_next_step>
Instruct the user to deploy using  and the updated Dockerfiles on their VM to verify the backend health check fix.
