The trajectory details the AI engineer's efforts to develop and deploy a CV application. Initially, it focused on debugging MongoDB connectivity, Docker health checks, and Portainer configurations, including shifts between single and two-container architectures. A significant pivot occurred when the user requested to eliminate MongoDB entirely, opting for JSON file-based data persistence. This led to a complete refactor of the backend and simplification of the frontend. Subsequently, the focus shifted to achieving a robust single-container deployment, which faced numerous Docker build and / errors. The AI iteratively simplified Dockerfiles, eventually resorting to serving pre-built HTML. The most recent challenge involves restoring the original frontend design, multi-language functionality, and a full Admin Panel after a minimal CV App Works version was successfully deployed, indicating a persistent issue with ensuring the correct frontend assets are used and served.

The user required a modern, conversion-optimized CV landing page with aesthetic design, animations, glassmorphism, responsiveness, and dynamic multi-language (English, Spanish, French) content. It needed a professional profile image, hero, experience, education, skills sections, PDF download, and a contact form. A secure, basic content management system (CMS) was requested for the Admin Panel to modify various sections. Deployment was initially via Docker and Portainer.

Explicit requests during development included:
- A simplified Portainer YML, with frontend on port 8006 and backend on 8007, without Nginx Proxy Manager config in the YML.
- Automatic and rapid data initialization, later shifting to a web-based data import/export system due to initialization failures.
- Debugging frontend-backend connection issues, including CORS and MongoDB connectivity.
- A functional frontend at .
- **Major change**: Remove MongoDB and use JSON for data persistence, simplifying the architecture to potentially a single container.
- Simplify Admin Panel: only 'Import' and core CV sections, remove 'Debug', 'Network' tabs.
- After achieving a basic CV App Works deployment, restore the original professional design, multi-language functionality, and a full-featured Admin Panel.

<key_technical_concepts>
- **Full-stack Architecture**: React (Frontend, initially), FastAPI (Backend), JSON (Data Storage, replaced MongoDB).
- **Deployment**: Docker, Portainer, Docker Compose.
- **Data Management**: File-based JSON storage, Pydantic.
- **Networking**: Docker networking, port mapping, CORS, Nginx (for static files/proxy).
- **Frontend Build**: Yarn, NPM, static HTML serving.

The application is a monorepo in , containing  (FastAPI) and  (React, later simplified to static HTML), with various Docker-related files.

**Key Files and Changes Summary:**
-   : Central FastAPI app. Initially modified for health checks and MongoDB connection, then drastically changed to remove MongoDB, incorporate JSON storage (), and serve static frontend files.
-   : **NEW** file, critical for the new architecture, handling all data persistence using JSON files.
-   : Modified to interact with  instead of MongoDB.
-   : Updated to remove  and other MongoDB-related dependencies.
-   :  variable was removed.
-   : Initially modified to add debug tabs, then simplified to remove them, but later the entire React frontend was replaced by static HTML files.
-   :  updated multiple times, most recently to .
-   : Numerous Dockerfiles (, ,  etc.) were created and iterated upon to address build issues, simplify the architecture (single container), and handle frontend compilation or serving pre-built assets.  is the current functional base.
-   : **NEW** directory created by Python scripts (, ) to house the generated static HTML files for the CV and Admin Panel.
-   : The current functional Portainer stack file, configured for a single container serving the backend and static HTML frontend on port 8006.
-   : Recent scripts to directly inject/update frontend HTML and logic within a running container to circumvent Docker build/deployment issues.

<pending_tasks>
- Fix the multi-language change functionality in the frontend.
- Correct the Admin Panel access, as it currently leads to the initial basic frontend version instead of the content manager.

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary request, the AI engineer was addressing two critical frontend issues reported by the user:
1.  **Multi-language change not functioning**: The user reported that the language switching feature on the frontend was broken.
2.  **Admin Panel access incorrect**: The Admin Panel URL () was not leading to the full content management interface but instead showing the basic frontend initially served.

This occurred after the AI had successfully deployed a minimal CV App Works version and then generated the full professional HTML frontend (including the Admin Panel) and instructed the user to redeploy using . When the user reported the design still didn't show, the AI created  and  to update files directly in the running container. While this improved the main CV design, it did not resolve the language issue or the Admin Panel redirection.

The AI's current approach is to create a new Python script, , which aims to comprehensively address both the language change and Admin Panel access issues by updating the frontend files in the running container. It also generated a corresponding shell script, üöÄ ARREGLANDO TODO - CAMBIO DE IDIOMAS + ADMIN COMPLETO
